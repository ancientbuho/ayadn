- replace mentions/links/hashtags text detection by accessing actual *entities* in the posts
- separate, abstract, DRY
- check every error scenario possible on the user + API side
- learn to run simulated tests like the big boys all do
- try and reduce the number of API calls
- replace the options system by a true switch system (maybe a gem)
- replace the custom compose window by something like *curses*
- config with yaml: reverse stream, color prefs, etc

- implement a ton of features (but that's another list...)

- replace mentions/links/hashtags text detection by accessing actual *entities* in the posts
- check every error scenario possible on the user + API side
- learn to run simulated tests like the big boys do
- replace the custom compose window by something like *curses*
- config with yaml: reverse stream, etc
- implement a ton of features (but that's another list...)
